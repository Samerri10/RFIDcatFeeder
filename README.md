Using Python to help feed my cats.....

BACKSTORY:  I have 2 cats, Pepper and Ninja. Ninja is a chonk and needs to be on a diet. Pepper has kidney disease and needs to be on a special prescription food to help disolve/prevent kidney stones.  The problem is... They hate their food, but LOVE each other's food. I'm using RFID tags on their collars to open a door (controlled by a Raspberry Pi) on a box so they can only eat their own food and not each other's. YAY! 🐱🐱
